The AIU Crop Recommendation System is a database-driven solution designed to support farmers and agricultural stakeholders in selecting the most suitable crops for their specific conditions. The prototype focuses on leveraging a structured database to analyze essential agricultural factors such as soil type, climate, water availability, and regional farming practices. By delivering accurate and actionable crop recommendations, the system aims to promote sustainable farming and improve agricultural productivity. Future enhancements will incorporate advanced technologies, including machine learning, to enable predictive analytics and more sophisticated decision-making capabilities.
